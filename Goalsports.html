          <h1>Goal sport</h1>
          <p>
            In sport, a goal may refer to either an instance of scoring, or to the physical structure or area where an
            attacking team must send the ball or puck in order to score points. The structure of a goal varies from
            sport to sport, and one is placed at or near each end of the playing field for each team to defend. For many
            sports, each goal structure usually consists of two vertical posts, called goal posts, supporting a
            horizontal crossbar. A goal line marked on the playing surface between the goal posts demarcates the goal
            area.
            The goal is the only method of scoring in several games. In each of these cases the winner is the team that
            scores the most goals within the specified time.

        <h2>1.Association football</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played with a
              spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over
              200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a
              rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to outscore the
              opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. The team with the higher number
              of goals wins the game.</p>
            <p>Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 cm
              (27–28 in) in circumference and known as the football. The two teams each compete to get the ball into the
              other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored
              more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then
              the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by
              the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.</p>
            <p>Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the
              goalkeepers within the penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but
              may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals
              by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or
              the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.</p>
            <p>Football is one of a family of football codes, which emerged from various ball games played worldwide
              since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the Laws of the Game were originally
              codified in England by The Football Association.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. According to FIFA, the
          Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball") is the earliest form of football for which there is
          evidence. Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball
          through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby
          occurred. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were
          established.</p>
        <p>Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games. An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a
          vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup.
          Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum
          were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and
          volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football. As with pre-codified "mob football", the
          antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking.Other
          games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea.</p>
        <p>The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C.W. Alcock and has been
          contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in
          1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C.W. Alcock. England is also home
          to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William
          McGregor. The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.</p>
        <p>Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to
          football stadiums to follow their favourite teams,while billions more watch the game on television or on
          the internet. A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a
          survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly
          play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.</p>

        <h4>Football at the Summer Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          Football at the Summer Olympics, commonly known as football or soccer, has been included in every Summer
          Olympic Games as a men's competition sport, except 1896 and 1932. Women's football was added to the official
          program at the 1996 Atlanta Games.</p>

        <h2>2.Basketball</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops, is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of
              five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of
              shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket
              18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court)
              while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points,
              unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and
              the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The
              team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied,
              an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>
            <p>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a
              teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the
              lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes,
              or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from
              rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry
              it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</p>
            <p>Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United
              States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.The
              National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world
              in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition. Outside North America, the top
              clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball
              Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the
              major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each
              continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.</p>
            <p>The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national
              teams from continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I
              Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague
              Women.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>In early December 1891, Canadian James Naismith, a physical education professor and instructor at the
          International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in
          Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous
          indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters.
          After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic
          rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach
          basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this
          proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with
          a long dowel each time.</p>
        <p>Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from "association football" were made,
          at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the
          other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in. These laces could cause
          bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable. Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was
          invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith. (Whereas in American football, the lace
          construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.) The first balls made
          specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a
          ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in
          common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the
          ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric
          shape of early balls.[dubious – discuss] Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble
          by 1898.The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892,
          with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the
          size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.</p>

        <h4>Basketball at the Summer Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          Basketball at the Summer Olympics has been a sport for men consistently since 1936. Prior to its inclusion as
          a medal sport, basketball was held as a demonstration event in 1904. Women's basketball made its debut in the
          Summer Olympics in 1976. FIBA organizes both the men's and women's FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournaments
          and the Summer Olympics basketball tournaments, which are sanctioned by the IOC.
        </p>
        <p>The United States is by far the most successful country in Olympic basketball, with United States men's teams
          having won 15 of 18 tournaments in which they participated, including seven consecutive titles from 1936
          through 1968. United States women's teams have won 8 titles out of the 10 tournaments in which they competed,
          including six in a row from 1996 to 2016. Besides the United States, Argentina is the only nation still in
          existence who has won either the men's or women's tournament. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the Unified
          Team are the countries no longer in existence who have won the tournament. The United States are the defending
          champions in both men's and women's tournaments.</p>
        <p>On June 9, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee announced that 3x3 basketball
          would become an official Olympic sport as of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, for both men and women.

              the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30

            <p>Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the middle of each
              end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter (20 ft) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed;
              goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while "diving" into it. The sport is
              usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech handball (which
              were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams
              now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few
              decades ago. Players may score hat tricks. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the
              attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft
              protective bands, pads and mouth guards.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Games similar to handball were played in Ancient Greece and are represented on amphoras and stone carvings.
          Although detailed textual reference is rare, there are numerous descriptions of ball games being played where
          players throw the ball to one another; sometimes this is done in order to avoid interception by a player on
          the opposing team. Such games were played widely and served as both a form of exercise and a social event.</p>
        <p>There is evidence of ancient Roman women playing a version of handball called expulsim ludere. There are
          records of handball-like games in medieval France, and among the Inuit in Greenland, in the Middle Ages. By
          the 19th century, there existed similar games of håndbold from Denmark, házená in the Czech Republic, handbol
          in Ukraine, and torball in Germany.</p>
        <p>The team handball game of today was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern Europe: primarily in
          Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden. The first written set of team handball rules was published in 1906 by the
          Danish gym teacher, lieutenant and Olympic medalist Holger Nielsen from Ordrup grammar school, north of
          Copenhagen. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 by Max Heiser, Karl Schelenz, and Erich
          Konigh from Berlin, Germany. 29 October 1917 is therefore seen as the "date of birth" of the sport. The
          first ever official handball match was played on 2 December 1917 in Berlin. After 1919 the rules were
          improved by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between Germany and
          Belgium by men in 1925 and between Germany and Austria by women in 1930.</p>
        <p>The International Handball Federation organised the men's world championship in 1938 and every four
          (sometimes three) years from World War II to 1995. Since the 1995 world championship in Iceland, the
          competition has been held every two years. The women's world championship has been held since 1957. The IHF
          also organizes women's and men's junior world championships. By July 2009, the IHF listed 166 member
          federations - approximately 795,000 teams and 19 million players.</p>

        <h4>Handball at the Summer Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          Handball at the Summer Olympics refers to two different sports. Field handball was introduced for men at the
          1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but dropped after that. At the 1952 Olympics, field handball was a
          demonstration sport. (Indoor) handball was introduced for men at the 1972 Summer Olympics, also on German
          territory. Women's handball competition was introduced at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.
