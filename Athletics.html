          <h1>Athletics</h1>
          <p>
            Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running, jumping, throwing, and walking.
            The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running, cross country running,
            and race walking.
            The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of
            the most common
            types of sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and
            competitions
            which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross country.

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>The steeplechase is an obstacle race in athletics, which derives its name from the steeplechase in horse
              racing. The foremost version of the event is the 3000 metres steeplechase. The 2000 metres steeplechase is
              the
              next most common distance. The 1900 Olympics featured a 2500 metres steeplechase and a 4000 metres
              steeplechase, and a 2590 metres steeplechase was held at the 1904 Olympics. A lap scoring error caused the
              1932 Olympics to feature an approximately 3460 meter steeplechase. A 1000 metres steeplechase is
              occasionally
              used in youth athletics.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>The event originated in Ireland. Horses and riders raced from one town's steeple to the next. The steeples
          were used as markers due to their visibility over long distances. Along the way runners inevitably had to jump
          streams and low stone walls separating estates. The modern athletics event originates from a two-mile (3.2 km)
          cross country steeplechase that formed part of the University of Oxford sports (in which many of the modern
          athletics events were founded)[citation needed] in 1860. It was replaced in 1865 by an event over barriers on
          a flat field, which became the modern steeplechase. It has been an Olympic event since the inception of the
          modern Olympics, though with varying lengths. Since the 1968 Summer Olympics, steeplechase in the Olympics has
          been dominated by Kenyan athletes, including the current gold medal streak since 1984 and a clean sweep of the
          medals at the 1992 and 2004 Games.</p>
          <p> The steeplechase for women is 3,000 metres long, but with lower barriers
          than for the men. A distance of 2,000 metres, with a shorter water jump, was experimented with before the
          current race format was established. It made its first major championship appearance at the 2005 World
          Championships in Helsinki. In 2008, women's 3,000 metres steeplechase appeared for the first time on the
          Olympic tracks in Beijing (see Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's 3000 metres steeplechase).</p>
          <p>Other divisions including masters athletics and youth athletics run 2,000 metres distances. The format for a
          2,000 metre steeplechase removes the first two barriers of the first lap.</p>
          <p> The steeplechase at the 1932 Olympics was run over approximately 3460 metres due to a lap scoring error.</p>

        <h4>Steeplechase at the Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          The steeplechase at the Summer Olympics has been held over several distances and is the longest track event
          with obstacles held at the multi-sport event. The men's 3000 metres steeplechase has been present on the
          Olympic athletics programme since 1920. The women's event is the most recent addition to the programme, having
          been added at the 2008 Olympics. It is the most prestigious steeplechase track race at elite level.</p>
          <p> The Olympic records for the event are 8:03.28 minutes for men, set by Conseslus Kipruto in 2016, and 8:58.81
          minutes for women, set by Gulnara Galkina in 2008. The IAAF officially recognises men's steeplechase world
          records after 1954, but unofficial world records were set in 1928, 1936 and 1952. Anders Gärderud's time of
          8:08.2 minutes from 1976 remains the only ratified men's steeplechase world record at the Olympics.
          Galkina's time was also a world record.</p>
          <p> Only two athletes have won multiple Olympic steeplechase titles Volmari Iso-Hollo (1932 and 1936) and Ezekiel Kemboi (2004 and 2012). Competitors in the steeplechase are
          normally event-specialists, although former champions Iso-Hollo, Ville Ritola and Kipchoge Keino all won
          Olympic medals in other distance running events.</p>
          <p> In spite of not reaching the podium until 1968, Kenya is the most successful nation in the steeplechase. It has won every men's title since 1968, with the exceptions of
          1976 and 1980, which Kenya boycotted. It had medals sweeps in 1992 and 2004. Finland is the next most
          successful nation with four gold medals. Finland in 1928 and Sweden in 1948 also have had medal sweeps. Kenya
          is also the most successful nation in the developing women's event, winning three of the 9 medals awarded
          since women started running the event in the Olympics, plus Kenyan born and still resident, 2016 champion Ruth
          Jebet switched allegiance to Bahrain for financial reasons.

        <h2>2.Cross country running</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over
              natural terrain such as dirt or grass. Sometimes the runners are referred to as harriers. The course,
              typically 4–12 kilometres (2.5–7.5 mi) long, may include surfaces of grass, and earth, pass through
              woodlands and open country, and include hills, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an
              individual and a team sport; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method.
              Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during autumn and
              winter, and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of
              temperatures.</p>
              <p>Cross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of athletics and is
              a natural-terrain version of long-distance track and road running. Although open-air running competitions
              are prehistoric, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English
              championship became the first national competition in 1876, and the International Cross Country
              Championships was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973, the foremost elite competition has been the
              IAAF World Cross Country Championships.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Formal cross country competition traces its history to the 19th century and an English game called "hare and
          hounds" or "the paper chase". English schools started competing in cross country races in 1837, and
          established a national championship on December 7, 1867. It was held on Wimbledon Common in south-west London.
          It was the first cross country race that was considered "open", or could be run by anyone. Its original
          purpose was to imitate steeplechase for off-season training, and was considered a bit of a joke.[citation
          needed] The race was about 3.5 miles long, and went through very boggy and hilly terrain. The course was not
          well marked, and many competitors got lost. Matters were not helped by the fact that the race was run in the
          dark, as it began at 5 pm.</p>

        <h4>Cross country running at the Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          Cross country running at the Summer Olympics was held at the multi-sport event for men only from 1912 to 1924.
          During its brief tenure as an Olympic event, it featured on the Olympic athletics programme. Medals were
          awarded on an individual race basis as well as a national team points basis.</p>
          <p> Traditionally a winter sport, the scheduling of cross country within a summer event caused organisational issues. The sport was dropped after
          1924 Olympics, when most of the runners dropped out due to extreme heat and pollution from a nearby power
          station.</p>
          <p> Over its three appearances at the Olympics, Finnish runners dominated the event. Tying in with the
          emergence of the Flying Finns, Hannes Kolehmainen won the inaugural event then Paavo Nurmi won the following
          two editions, winning gold medals both individually and in the team race.</p>
          <p> Haile Gebrselassie, Kenenisa Bekele and Paul Tergat, all highly successful African long-distance runners, jointly issued an open letter in 2008 to
          the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge, urging him to consider the re-instatement
          of cross country as an Olympic sport. The International Association of Athletics Federations and athletics
          media have supported the idea of including the sport at the Winter Olympic Games. The IOC defines winter
          sports as those requiring snow or ice, presenting a possible block on its inclusion. Although the sport does
          not require such conditions, major cross country events have been held on snow on numerous occasions.

        <h2>3.The triple jump</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>The triple jump, sometimes referred to as the hop, step and jump or the hop, skip and jump, is a track
              and field event, similar to the long jump. As a group, the two events are referred to as the "horizontal
              jumps". The competitor runs down the track and performs a hop, a bound and then a jump into the sand pit.
              The triple jump was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympics event since the
              Games' inception in 1896.</p>
              <p> According to IAAF rules, "the hop shall be made so that an athlete lands first on the same foot as that from which he has taken off; in the step he shall land on the other foot,
              from which, subsequently, the jump is performed."</p>
              <p> The current male and female world record holders are Jonathan Edwards of Great Britain & N.I., with a jump of 18.29 m (60 ft 0 in), and Inessa Kravets of
              Ukraine, with a jump of 15.50 m (50 ft 10 in). Both records were set during 1995 World Championships in
              Gothenburg.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Historical sources on the ancient Olympic Games occasionally mention jumps of 15 meters or more. This led
          sports historians to conclude that these must have been a series of jumps, thus providing the basis for the
          triple jump. However, there is no evidence for the triple jump being included in the ancient Olympic Games,
          and it is possible that the recorded extraordinary distances are due to artistic license of the authors of
          victory poems, rather than attempts to report accurate results.</p>
          <p> The triple jump was a part of the inaugural modern Olympics in Athens, although at the time it consisted of two hops on the same foot and then a jump.
          In fact, the first modern Olympic champion, James Connolly, was a triple jumper. Early Olympics also included
          the standing triple jump, although this has since been removed from the Olympic program and is rarely
          performed in competition today. The women's triple jump was introduced into the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.</p>
          <p>In Irish mythology the geal-ruith (triple jump), was an event contested in the ancient Irish Tailteann Games
          as early as 1829 BC.</p>

        <h4>Triple jump at the Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          The triple jump at the Summer Olympics is grouped among the four track and field jumping events held at the
          multi-sport event. The men's triple jump has been present on the Olympic athletics programme since the first
          Summer Olympics in 1896. The women's triple jump is one of the more recent additions to the programme, having
          been first contested in 1996. It became the third Olympic jumping event for women after the high jump and long
          jump.</p>
          <p> The Olympic records for the event are 18.09 m (59 ft 4 in) for men, set by Kenny Harrison in 1996, and
          15.39 m (50 ft 5 3⁄4 in) for women, set by Françoise Mbango Etone in 2008. The men's triple jump world record
          was broken at the competition in 1924, 1932, 1936, 1956 and 1968. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, three men
          improved the record a total of five times at the high altitude of Mexico City. The women's world record has
          never been broken at the Olympics and the current mark of 15.50 m (50 ft 10 in), set in 1995, pre-dates the
          first Olympic event.</p>
          <p> James Brendan Connolly was the first Olympic triple jump champion and, as it was the first event to conclude in 1896, he was also the first Olympic champion of the modern era. Inessa Kravets,
          the world record holder, became the first women's champion 100 years later. American Christian Taylor and
          Colombian Caterine Ibargüen are the reigning Olympic champions from 2016.</p>
          <p> Viktor Saneyev is the event's most successful athlete as he was Olympic champion three times consecutively from 1968 to 1976, as well as
          runner-up in 1980. Françoise Mbango Etone is the only woman to win two Olympic triple jump titles. Saneyev,
          Vilho Tuulos and Tatyana Lebedeva are the only three athletes to have won more than two Olympic medals in the
          event. The United States is the most successful nation in the event, with eight gold medals to its name. The
          Soviet Union is the next most successful, with four golds.</p>
          <p> A short-lived standing triple jump variant of the event was contested in 1900 and 1904 and standing jumps specialist Ray Ewry won both gold medals.
