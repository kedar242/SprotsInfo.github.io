          <h1>Net sport</h1>
          <p>
            A net sport is a sport where a net is a standard part of the game, especially where the net separates the
            opponents. The object of these games is to hit the ball or bird over the net back to the opponent. Play
            typically begins with one side serving the ball/bird by initially tossing or releasing it and then hitting
            it over the net. This then starts a rally, in which the sides alternate hitting the ball/bird over the net.
            Players then score points whenever the opponent fails to return the ball/bird back over the net. The
            criteria on what is considered a valid return varies between each sport (such as the number of times the
            ball may be touched or bounced on a player's side before it must go back over the net).
          </p>
          <p>Net sports usually include:</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>racquet sports such as tennis, badminton, pickleball and table tennis (but not squash or racquetball,
              where players must hit the ball towards a wall).</li>
            <li>volleyball, footvolley, headis, roundnet or sepak takraw, where players must hit the ball with body.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Although basketball, hockey, water polo and other sports have netting around the goal area designed to more
            clearly indicate when goals are scored, they are not usually considered "net sports". Similarly, lacrosse
            sticks have a loose netting that is used to catch and fling the ball, but again lacrosse is not usually
            considered a "net sport".

        <h2>1.Badminton</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be
              played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and
              "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or
              on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the
              shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.</p>
            <p>
              Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
              shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their
              absence) the opposing side.</p>

            <p> The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from
              the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the
              shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in
              other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.</p>

            <p> The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play
              came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions
              dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles,
              women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles added four years later. At high
              levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength,
              speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development
              of sophisticated racquet movements.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia,[a] but the modern game of
          badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the British as a variant of the earlier game of battledore
          and shuttlecock. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".) Its exact origin remains obscure. The name
          derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire, but why or when remains unclear. As
          early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore – A
          New Game, but no copy is known to have survived. An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton
          as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".
        </p>
        <p>The game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in British India, where it was very popular
          by the 1870s. Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being
          played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the
          British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.</p>
        <p>Early on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of Poona, where it was
          particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873. By 1875, officers returning
          home had started a badminton club in Folkestone. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to
          4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best. The
          shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with lead. Although the
          depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.</p>
        <p>The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath Badminton Club drew up
          revised regulations.In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules. The Badminton Association of
          England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called "Dunbar" in
          Portsmouth on 13 September. The BAE started the first badminton competition, the All England Open Badminton
          Championships for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899. Singles competitions were
          added in 1900 and an England–Ireland championship match appeared in 1904.</p>
        <h4>Badminton at the Summer Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          Badminton had its debut as official event on the 1992 Summer Olympics and has been contested in seven
          Olympiads. 69 different nations have appeared in the Olympic badminton competitions, with 19 appearing all
          seven times. It is governed by the Badminton World Federation.</p>

        <h2>2.Tennis</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between
              two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
              strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The
              object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid
              return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
            </p>
            <p>Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be
              played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated
              in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various
              field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real
              tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn
              tennis.</p>
            <p>The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961
              the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s.
              A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled
              with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known
              as Hawk-Eye.</p>
            <p>Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The
              four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open
              played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and
              the US Open also played on hard courts.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>The racket sport traditionally named lawn tennis, now commonly known simply as tennis is the direct
          descendant of what is now denoted real tennis or royal tennis, which continues to be played today as a
          separate sport with more complex rules. Most rules of (lawn) tennis derive from this precursor and it is
          reasonable to see both sports as variations of the same game. Most historians believe that tennis originated
          in the monastic cloisters in northern France in the 12th century, but the ball was then struck with the palm
          of the hand; hence, the name jeu de paume ("game of the palm"). It was not until the 16th century that rackets
          came into use, and the game began to be called "tennis." It was popular in England and France, and Henry VIII
          of England was a big fan of the game, now referred to as real tennis.</p>
        <p>Many original tennis courts remain, including courts at Oxford, Cambridge, Falkland Palace in Fife where Mary
          Queen of Scots regularly played, and Hampton Court Palace. Many of the French courts were decommissioned with
          the terror that accompanied the French Revolution. The Tennis Court Oath (Serment du Jeu de Paume) was a
          pivotal event during the first days of the French Revolution. The Oath was a pledge signed by 576 of the 577
          members from the Third Estate who were locked out of a meeting of the Estates-General on 20 June 1789.</p>

        <h4>Tennis at the Summer Olympics</h4>
        <p>
          Tennis was part of the Summer Olympic Games program from the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics, but was dropped
          after the 1924 Summer Olympics due to disputes between the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the
          International Olympic Committee over how to define amateur players. After two appearances as a
          demonstration sport in 1968 and 1984 (with a U-21 age limit), it returned as a full medal sport at the 1988
          Summer Olympics open for all players regardless of their age and status and has been played at every edition
          of the Games since then.
        </p>
        <p>In 1896, 1900, 1904, 1988, and 1992, semifinal losers shared bronze medals. In all other years, a playoff
          match for the bronze medal was staged.</p>
        <p>In the past, results from the Olympics used to have ranking points that the ATP and WTA added to their
          players annual totals in singles for that calendar year. This occurred from the 2004 Athens until the 2012
          London editions. No points were awarded for the editions prior and for the 2016 Rio Olympics. While the
          ranking points amount did not equate with those given at the Grand Slam tournaments, the Olympic tournaments
          have increased in perceived importance since their reintroduction, with some players, critics and sports
          pundits considering winning the gold at the Olympics just as prestigious as winning a Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>A player who wins an Olympic gold medal and all four Grand Slam events in the same year is said to have won a
          Golden Slam. As of 2016, Steffi Graf is the only player to have completed this achievement.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a
              lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. The
              game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally
              as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table,
              and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player
              fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball
              alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.</p>
            <p>Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF),
              founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations. The table tennis official rules are
              specified in the ITTF handbook. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, with several
              event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and
              women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>The sport originated in Victorian England, where it was played among the upper-class as an after-dinner
          parlour game. It has been suggested that makeshift versions of the game were developed by British
          military officers in India around the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them. A row of books stood
          up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit
          a golf-ball.</p>
        <p>The name "ping-pong" was in wide use before British manufacturer J. Jaques & Son Ltd trademarked it in 1901.
          The name "ping-pong" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive Jaques's equipment, with
          other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold
          the rights to the "ping-pong" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the
          term in the 1920s making the various associations change their names to "table tennis" instead of the more
          common, but trademarked, term.</p>
        <p>The next major innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British enthusiast of table tennis, who discovered novelty
          celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C.
          Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of pimpled, or stippled,
          rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis was growing in popularity by 1901 to the extent that tournaments were
          being organized, books being written on the subject, and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902.
        </p>
        <p>In 1921, the Table Tennis Association was founded, and in 1926 renamed the English Table Tennis
          Association. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926. London hosted the
          first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called
          USA Table Tennis, was formed.</p>

        <h4>Table tennis at the Summer Olympics</h4>
        <p>

          men and women. Athletes from China have dominated the sport, winning a total of 53 medals in 32 events,
          including 28 out of a possible 32 gold medals, and only failing to at least medal in one event, the inaugural
          Men's Singles event at the 1988 Summer Olympics.
